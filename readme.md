1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
getElementById selects a single element by its unique id. getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements by class name and returns an HTMLCollection. querySelector selects the first matching element using a CSS selector, while querySelectorAll selects all matching elements and returns a NodeList.

2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
You can create a new element using document.createElement(). Then you can add content or attributes to it. Finally, insert it into the DOM using methods like appendChild() or append().

3. What is Event Bubbling? And how does it work?
Event Bubbling is a process where an event starts from the target element and then propagates upward to its parent elements. When an event occurs on a child element, it first runs on that element and then bubbles up to its ancestors.

4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Event Delegation is a technique where a parent element handles events for its child elements using event bubbling. Instead of adding event listeners to multiple child elements, we add a single listener to the parent. It is useful because it improves performance and works for dynamically added elements.

5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
preventDefault() stops the default browser behavior of an event, such as preventing a form from submitting. stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements. In short, preventDefault() blocks default action, while stopPropagation() blocks event propagation.
